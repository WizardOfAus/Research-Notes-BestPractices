Notes/Tutorials on best practices in research

Resources for CS Research

## Tools for Reading Papers:

* [Google Scholar] (https://scholar.google.com/) * [CiteSeer] (http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/index;jsessionid=FBBDBD6285DBEEE56F7D15668C79C657) * [ACM Digital Library] (http://dl.acm.org/) * [IEEE Xplore] (http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp) * [DBLP] (http://dblp.uni-trier.de/) * Last but not least, don't forget your local library
Be wary, these platforms are often highly biased towards recent results.

# There are 4 main types of papers that exist:

* **Survey Papers**: Good to accumulate relevant citations (also tutorial). * **Vision/Position Papers**: Understanding what questions are important for community (not result oriented). * **Experimental Papers**: Fundamental paper accumulating experimental results. * **Theoretical Papers**: Fundamental paper accumulating theoretical results.
Little known fact: If you'd like to use a paper that you can’t find for free online, you can always email the author.

## Tools for Organizing Papers:

* [Mendeley] (https://www.mendeley.com/) * [Papers] (http://www.papersapp.com/) * [EndNote] (http://endnote.com/) * [BibDesk] (http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net/)
Organization is necessary! Read 100+ papers/year to keep up with industry discourse.

## Misc. words of wisdom when picking an interesting question/finding sound papers:
- Be suspicious of papers that claim to be the **next best thing** and don’t admit any limitations - Reference **limitations or future work of other papers** for interesting material to research - Try to **focus on good science** as opposed to research fads (cough, cough, deep learning) - There are many asked questions that we are now developing the tech for, so **research past papers** - Use insights of references, but **avoid duplication**; use methodology - Find **earliest known results** on a topic - Add a few **irrelevant papers** if they look interesting, could help to improve research question - Theorize how those in **other fields** would go about your question - Specify your research question, if you’ve found it’s already been answered, **write a follow-up question** (It’s a good thing if you find a paper that’s already been tackled - it means you’re asking the right questions)
